The FarmData2 module aims to extends farmOS by adding data input forms, 
reporting and analytics that support the day-to-day operation of 
diversified vegetable farms. The data input forms and reporting will 
support farmers in keeping records necessary for organic certification 
and for the study of sustainable farming practices.
