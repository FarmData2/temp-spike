The FarmData2 module aims to extend farmOS by adding data input forms, 
reporting, and analytics that support the day-to-day operation of 
diversified vegetable farms. The data input forms and reporting 
facilitate the keeping of records necessary for organic certification 
and for the study of sustainable farming practices.
